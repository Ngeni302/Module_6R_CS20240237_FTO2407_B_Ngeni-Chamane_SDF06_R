2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Describe your key interests related to your career.
    I have always managed to find my way around a computer/laptop ever since I was young so working with laptops/computers is always a fun experience for me. Also,I was exposed to programming in university but not in depth but that experience left me more interested and eager to learn more about coding/programming the idea of writing commands to a computer and watching it display that 
    command in the form of a visual display is very exciting.  Furthermore, I've always had a creative side from creating dress designs as a kid, being creative in the outfits i put together so I am excited to see how being creative translates in software development. 

    - What values are important to you in a work environment?
    First on my list is respect. I am a huge advocate for respect irrespective of people's levels at work or their education I truly believe in respecting everyone you work with, from the ceo to the people cleaning the offices.I also value integrity and having strong moral and ethical principles and i believe they will always help you in the long run at work and even in your own personal life. I also value personal development. In our culture we have a saying about how one never stops learning and that could be furthering your academic career or self-development. it is important to learn and evolve even in a work environment for your own benefit and as a means to upgrade yourself.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - List the industries or roles you have researched: information systems
                                                        information technology
                                                        system engineering
                                                        data science/analyst


    - Note any particular areas that piqued your interest.
    systems engineering and information system really piqued my interests. Systems engineering because 
    a part of me may still want a way to go back in the engineering field ad=nd eventually graduate as an engineer but focusing on managing/working with systems. Information systems seems interesting to me because as a commerce field there is a part that delves into the commerce sphere which i have always had an interest in.

2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Reflect on how these industries/roles align with your skills, interests, and values.
    Engineering requires someoone who has good problem solving skills and I would like to believe that I have achieved that based on the degree I was doing, it forced me to always find another way if one way doesn't work. Both of these fields require integrity and moral principles as they closely deal with people's live(systems engineering) and the other field had finances involved and when dealing with money you always have to have your moral compass facing north.

    - Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
    I would like to delve more towards commerce in the tech industry and finding mentors/networks within that space. 


### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
    1) wake up everyday and be able to exercise first.
    2) lead a healthy lifestyle(eating healthy)
    3) work on my time management.
    4) complete my softeware development certification.
    5) go back to university next year.

    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.
    1) waking up early and being able to exercise would allow me the opportunity to get more thigns done and keep me healthy.
    2) everything you eat affects your wellbeing even your mental health therefore it is one of the ways I want to keep sane and healthy.
    3) Managing my time would mean me having enough time to study and relax as not relaxing and having time outs could affect my mental health.
    4) It would be my start towards getting into the IT/Software development field as the world is moving towards more technology.
    5) I need to have something in my hand in the form of a degree as education does go a long way and i come from a family of graduates so the pressure is on.


2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Outline your long-term career aspirations.
    1) Be a university graduate.
    2) have my own apartment and a car.
    3) have a well paying job at a bank/or oversees.

    - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.
    If I get a degree in one of the fields i mentioned I know that that would be my ticket to a better future and this would be a way for my self-development. gaining that experience and working at an oversees company and also having my own apartment and car would further help my self-development journey. 


### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.
    1) slepeing early and having supper before 7pm will help me wake up refreshed and in that way i get my 8 hours of sleep.
    2) buying fresh foods and having properly proportioned meals.
    3) Using sunday to preplan for my week. I will preplan for the foods i will eat, when do i take a break from studying and for how long, breaking uo the work that needs to be done and sticking to a routine.
    4) get a good support system from home and making sure that my chores at home dont clash with the my school work. putting in extra hours if i need to.
    5) applying to different universities this year and also try to find funding for my studies but also again a good support system at home.

    - Include any resources or support required.
    i would need a good study area where there is no noise, support from my family as this next six months feels like it will be extra hard, support from codespace with our schoolwork.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
    1) letting go of whatever happened in the past and forgiving myself so that I can look forward to the journey of starting university all over again so that i can excel in the end and be a graduate.
    2) Patience is a virtue but while i will wait for a high paying job i might continue to get certifications on the side as they go a long way in the tech industry  but also it would posiiton me well for the careers i could apply for.
    3) get more certifications or maybe further my studies and make sure i absorb all the experience i will gain in industry which could make me a well positioned applicant.

    - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.
    time management, maybe an honours degree, being a team player.

    Not getting into a university for next year, not having funding for my studies next year, not being able to study well as there is no proper study area, getting demotivated because i feel left behing in life.

    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.
    having a clear mind and knowing what i want out of life, to keep applying even for the roles/bursaries i dont qualify for, overlooking my home situation but instead to put in the work so i can get the results. 
2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.

    find a mentor in the fields i am interested in and in that way i amy be able to have a clearer view/idea of where i am headed.
    join networking programmes in the tech industry.

    - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.
